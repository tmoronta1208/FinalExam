# FinalExam

Challenges:
 Overall the app was very straighforward but I struggled with the networking and parsing the JSON. I implemented retrofit but was unable to complete
 the DogActivity unfortunately, due to not being able to retrieve the response.body correctly. 
 I also spent too much time in the beggining of class on the Shared Preferences and also struggled with checking the preferences so the user remains logged in. 
 I was also unable to implement the logout options. 
 
 Wins:
 Passing bundles and Intents.
 Setting up Recycler View. 
 
 Moving Forward:
 Will focus on networking and working with POJO's. 
 Time management and MVP.
